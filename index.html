<button class="collapsible">YouTube marketing agency offers a tool to grow YouTube Ad revenue and minimise budget</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Dear Jhon, My name is Loundia and I’ve been working as a social media
    consultant for the past X years. I noticed your brand and I saw that you
    were running an ad on YouTube. Although, your ad might be getting nice
    results since it is showing at the top of the search results - you are
    spending way too much money and you are not getting as many clients as you
    should be. Due to that fact, I have a simple tool for you that can boost
    your marketing campaigns to the moon by helping you reach real, potential
    clients at a very low price. Not only that, but this tool can even help you
    go viral! What does this tool? It will find your ideal audience. With
    connections to YouTube's Ads platform and websites, this tool can reach up
    to 90% of the internet. No audience is too difficult to find!
    It will filter low engaging viewers. When promoting your video, we
    automatically filter out "low engagement" viewers (such as kids on parents
    devices) to maximize your budget. Real engagement from real viewers. We
    promise to never use bots, click farms, or pay people to watch your videos.
    All growth is real with no risk to your channel! ..and much more. If you
    want to find out more about this tool click here: https://bit.ly/2RMLgqw
    Looking forward to seeing your promo video going viral! Yours sincerely,
    Loundia Disclosure: Bear in mind that some of the links in this email are
    affiliate links and if you go through them to make a purchase I will earn a
    commission. Keep in mind that I link these companies and their products
    because of their quality and not because of the commission I receive from
    your purchases. The decision is yours, and whether or not you decide to buy
    something is completely up to you.

<div class="content">

    Hi John,
    Given that I am a huge fan of your channel, I wanted to make sure you are safe and healthy and are taking necessary precautions. My name is Kunal, and I lead growth for InVideo (https://t.sidekickopen09.com/s1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lM8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XWPdSD1CW7fRHfM5vfRdxM1kjp6DNmkq103?te=W3R5hFj26QkH5W41ZnFj3K7sCD348V2&si=8000000000394194&pi=748c4e3d-17f4-4bf4-e935-e3e1caaa9675) - the world’s easiest online video creation software where we aim at empowering anyone and everyone to create stunning videos within minutes.
    I know this is not the best time to reach out for a collaboration, but in this chaotic environment, the only silver lining to the current times is that people have a bit more time on their hands to invest in learning and consume content online, and that's why this may be the best time to reach out to them with high-quality content. We'd love to work with you on some very interesting concepts such as 'how to create Facebook ads in 2020' or 'how to create Facebook ads in under 10 minutes' or any other concepts that may have the most amount of value add for your audience.
    There is no better time to create value for people and help people through your business in the best way possible. And that is what we have been doing over the past two weeks, by creating an entire repository of precautionary videos around Coronavirus and making them absolutely free for anyone and everyone to use. Would love for you to have a look - Coronavirus communication templates (https://t.sidekickopen09.com/s1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lM8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XWPdSD1CW7fRHfM5vfRdxM1kjp6DNmkq103?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW3T1lt33H4T2bW3T1FKm43WgqvW3ZZpwX3_R5ZJW3K9F8z3NBbrcW3_Ylyw4fGCs7W4cJ1nT3F7tNBW2f6Kt-43TBFTf3T30h104&si=8000000000394194&pi=748c4e3d-17f4-4bf4-e935-e3e1caaa9675)
    We strongly believe we have a lot of synergies in terms of adding value for your audience and our users in these hard times. Please let us know how we can add value to your audience and community. We will go above and beyond in terms of making this happen. Look forward to hearing from you. :)

    Hey John and team,
    I'm Troy from Studypool - we're relevant to your video content on YouTube, and we'd like to see if there's an opportunity to work together through a sponsored video or shout out / mention.
    We're an on-demand tutoring platform with 150K freelancing tutors that have found success working from home. Our typical tutors/freelancers can make anywhere from a few hundred to 7.5K a month but we also have a few that make much more (since we have over 3.1M students). We've raised several million dollars and are a fast growing startup that wants to let more potential tutors/freelancers know about us.
    Here's some PR about us:

<div class="content">
  <p>collab@movavi.com 

    Hello John!
     
    My name is Rina, and I work with Movavi (https://www.movavi.com/video-editor-plus/) . In case you’re not familiar with us, we make intuitive yet powerful software for Windows and Mac users. We are convinced that video production should be a simple and fun process, and therefore we made our program as user-friendly as possible.
     
    I recently came across your channel, and I love your videos and the way your audience is engaged with them, so we’d really like to find a way to work with you.
     
    You pay a great attention to earning opportunities on the Internet in your videos, so it seems to me that some part of your audience consists of people who want to start shooting their video blog and make money on YouTube. Our program is the best tool for them because you don’t need to have special skills and experience to express yourself on video.
     
    If you are interested in working with us, please specify your price, date and the type of collaboration we can expect from you. We are open to any ideas and ready to discuss them with you.
     
    You’ll find more information about Movavi and get a quick overview of the program in our media kit (in the attachment).
     
    Have a great day,
    Rina, Movavi
