<button class="collapsible">Oscar CEO of Culture Closers offers cooperation related to helping increase SAS price X4 times, and get commissions for it.</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Dear John Crestani and the John Crestani team.

    First of all, I know that I am contacting you on your support email, but I did not manage to find your personal.
    
    My name is Oskar E. V. Lundtoft - Chief Executive Officer of Culture Closers. 
    I am contacting you on behalf of my company to present a potential business cooperation between the two of us. 
    A cooperation that if conducted correctly can be extremely profitable for both you and me.
    
    In the past week, I spend countless hours studying you and your Super Affiliate System PRO course. Personally, I believe in the power of affiliate marketing, but I also know that it can be a jungle for the average person to understand. I, therefore, acknowledge and appreciate the fact that you through both your course and free training make it possible for the average person to navigate through that jungle.
    
    When that is said, I also know that your bank account benefits a lot from this as well. Through my calculations, you have earned millions teaching this. 
    I am not here to complain about the fact that you charge money for your wisdom, that is completely okay with me. 
    In fact, I think you are charging way less than you should be.
    
    This announcement may seem strange to you, but please hear what I have to say.
    
    At the time I am writing this email, you charge $997USD for Super Affiliate System PRO.
    
    You have students earning hundreds of thousands of dollars by implementing what you teach. 
    To your students, don't you think results like that are worth way more than a thousand dollars?Of course, they are. That is the reason why I believe that you should increase the price tag of Super Affiliate System PRO.
    
    At this point, you are properly thinking something in the lines of this: "I can't increase my prices without losing my ability to attach clients"
    
    Before you lock your mind on the thought that it is undoable, take a look at this.
    
    As you properly already know, Dan Lok, The King Of High-Ticket Sales™ runs a course on High-Ticket Closing. 
    From the launch of that course and 2 years forward, it was priced at $2,500USD.
    
    A few months ago, Dan Lok decided to change the price.
    
    Did he increase it with 20%? 
    No.
    
    Did he increase it with 50%? 
    No.
    
    Did he increase it with 100%? 
    No.
    
    What he did was increasing the price with no less than 400%. This means that instead of charging $2,500USD, he now charges $10,000USD. 
    The interesting part is that the new price attracts the same amount of clients as the old one, but now each is paying 4 times more.
    
    In my company, we have experts trained in replicating the change that Dan Lok created.
    
    This leads me to our actual cooperation.
    
    If you decided that it is something you want to move forward with, we will help you do this in exchange for a commission on the profit we help you generate.
    
    In other words, we will take on all the risk and you will only pay us on the results we help you create.
    
    If you have any questions related to this email, please don't hesitate to contact me. 
    I am looking forward to your reply and start creating some results together. 
    Sincerely, 
    CEO of Culture Closers, ApS.

<button class="collapsible">Saul DeMoss Owner of "Your Sign Resource" offers Billboard advertising! </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Hi John,

    I have been following your videos on youtube for free ways to advertise for your super affiliate product. I am in the sign industry and have recently come across a company that leases out free advertising space on digital billboards nationwide. I wanted to see if there was a possibility of using this medium for advertising.
    
    I also have another digital display company in talks with a company similar to blip billboards allowing businesses with digital signage to lease out advertising space on their displays. This company is more focused on business signs such as brick and mortar and shopping center multi-tenant locations, rather than highway billboards.
    
    I would be interested in seeing if there may be a way to do affiliate marketing using this new form of digital advertising with highway billboards and brick and mortar digital displays.
    
    I'm sure this goes to your support, but if this is of any interest to you please get in touch. Below is the company I am referring to if you'd like to review.

  <p>Hello John,

    I wanted to offer you a free opportunity to help you get people funded for
    your product. My name is Jennifer Pullen and I am a partner with Fundwise
    Capital. We would like to partner with you because of your social media
    influence. Basically, we would set you up with a link to share with your
    followers. We do funding from $50K up to $1 Million for businesses and
    small business owners. You would make a 20% override on every origination
    fee for each loan that you refer. People can apply easily and it is a soft
    pull so it won't ruin their credit. An example is that if someone
    qualifies for $50K the origination is $4500 and you would make $900. We
    would make you a partner page that you could pin in your group and you will
    be able to track all of your leads. Here is a sample:
    https://apply.fundwise.com/jpullen
    I hope you will consider this opportunity. It is available to all in the
