<button class="collapsible">A internet 'hacker', supposedly famous, offers the only 100% safe link cloackig service, Amazon compliant </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Hey John,

    Just dropping you a line personally real quick, hopefully this reaches you.
    
    How would you like to promote the world’s only true link cloaker, that is also 100% compliant with Amazon’s policy against cloaked links? Sounds impossible I know but trust me, it’s not. ;)
    
    Promoting this to your audience/list will not only make you a pile of easy money, but it will help all of those who follow your teachings to make more money as well.
    
    I’m very serious about this. I’ve been an active affiliate and software developer since 2005 and am well known in the industry, though I’ve been “underground” doing my thing quietly for about the last 6 or 7 years. I’ve decided to emerge again and let the world have some of my tools.
    
    Feel free to Google me if you like, “Jonathan van Clute”. I’m the guy behind LPGen, WPGen, PPVDominator, Easy Prepop, KWBot, and ShadowClicks as well as many other tools that were never made public.
    
    This is my personal email address, I look forward to telling you more.

<button class="collapsible">U.S. TV channel offers exposure as a coach, by showing families in need how to get/save money on TV. </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Dear Mr. Crestani,

    I hope you don't mind me getting in touch. My name is Matt and I am a Producer at Naked TV. I am looking for super savers bursting with top money saving tips to share with families in financial need for a brand-new TV show for a major US Network. I just came across your excellent Youtube channel and felt compelled to get in touch.
    
    Seizing control of household budgets you will give feckless families a crash course in super-scrimping. Five families/ households will have an ultimate money saving goal in mind and you will ensure they smash their target.
    
    From dumpster diving to using and rewashing cloth baby diapers; from batch cooking and freezing a month’s worth of meals, to getting crafty and giving homemade gifts. If you are willing to share your frugal ways and inspire America, then we’d love to arrange a chat on the phone.
    
    If you are interested in finding out more please let me know when you are available for a call and the best number to reach you on.
    
    Thank You,
    
    Matt
